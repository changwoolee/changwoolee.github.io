I am a fourth year Ph. D. student in the [department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.engin.umich.edu) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) (U of M), advised by Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu).

My research is centered around improving the efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) and DNN-based methods including Transformers and Diffusion models. To do so, I am interested in using theoretical tools such as sparse and low-rank matrix approximation, randomized linear algebra, and nonparametric regression and density estimation.   

Before I join U of M, I received my M.S. and B.S. at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng), Seoul, Republic of Korea.
