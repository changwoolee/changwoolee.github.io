I am a third year Ph. D. student in the [department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://ece.engin.umich.edu) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu) (U of M), working with Prof. [Hun-Seok Kim](https://kim.engin.umich.edu).
My research interest lies in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Signal Processing. 


Before starting my Ph.D. program at U of M, I received my M.S. in [Electronics and Computer Engineering](http://electronic.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/main/index.php) at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng), Seoul, Republic of Korea, in 2020.
I also received my B.S. in [Electronic Engineering](http://electronic.hanyang.ac.kr/eng/main/index.php) at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng), Seoul, Korea in 2018.
